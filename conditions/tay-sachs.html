                        <h2 id="overview">What is Tay-Sachs Disease?</h2>
                        <p>Tay-Sachs disease is a devastating progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects infants and young children. Named after British ophthalmologist Warren Tay and American neurologist Bernard Sachs who first described it in the late 19th century, this genetic condition is caused by the absence or severe deficiency of an essential enzyme called Hexosaminidase A (Hex A).</p>
                        
                        <p>The disease occurs when harmful substances called GM2 gangliosides accumulate in nerve cells throughout the body, particularly in the brain and spinal cord. Without the Hex A enzyme to break down these fatty substances, they build up to toxic levels, progressively destroying nerve cells and causing severe neurological deterioration.</p>
                        
                        <p>Tay-Sachs disease is particularly prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, where approximately 1 in 27 individuals are carriers of the genetic mutation, compared to about 1 in 300 people in the general population. This higher frequency is attributed to a founder effect and genetic bottlenecks in the Ashkenazi Jewish population throughout history.</p>

                            <h4>Important Medical Note</h4>
                            <p>Tay-Sachs disease is a serious medical condition that requires professional medical care and genetic counseling. This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace consultation with qualified healthcare providers.</p>

                        <h2 id="genetics">Genetics and Inheritance</h2>
                        <p>Tay-Sachs disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means that both parents must be carriers of the genetic mutation for their child to be affected by the disease. The condition is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, located on chromosome 15, which provides instructions for making the Hex A enzyme.</p>

                        <h3>How Inheritance Works</h3>
                        <p>When both parents are carriers (each having one normal copy and one mutated copy of the HEXA gene), each pregnancy has:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            <li><strong>25% chance</strong> - Child will have Tay-Sachs disease (inherits two mutated copies)</li>
                            <li><strong>50% chance</strong> - Child will be a carrier like the parents (inherits one normal, one mutated copy)</li>
                            <li><strong>25% chance</strong> - Child will be unaffected and not a carrier (inherits two normal copies)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Common Mutations in Jewish Populations</h3>
                        <p>Several specific mutations in the HEXA gene are more common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            <li><strong>4-bp insertion in exon 11</strong> - Most common mutation, accounting for about 80% of Tay-Sachs alleles in Ashkenazi Jews</li>
                            <li><strong>G269S mutation</strong> - Second most common, found in about 15% of cases</li>
                            <li><strong>IVS12+1G→C</strong> - Less common but still significant in this population</li>

She tested positive for Gaucher disease, but when the genetic counselor described Tay-Sachs symptoms, we realized they matched what I had been experiencing for years. It took genetic testing for another condition to finally solve the mystery of my health problems." - Based on community experiences shared in Jewish health forums</p>

                            <p>"The first community carrier screening event was held in 1971 at a synagogue in Maryland. Trained volunteers and physicians drew blood from over 1,500 people, which revealed if they had a possibility of having a child with Tay-Sachs. For the first time, people had knowledge about personal risk of having affected kids. The number of babies born with Tay-Sachs has reduced over 90% in the last 50 years due to people being more educated about personal risk and taking the time to learn what they can do for prevention." - From Jewish genetics community archives</p>

                        <h2 id="treatment">Treatment and Management</h2>
                        <p>Currently, there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, and treatment focuses on supportive care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. However, significant research is ongoing into potential therapeutic approaches.</p>

                        <h3>Current Supportive Care</h3>
                        <p><strong>Nutritional Support:</strong> As swallowing becomes difficult, feeding tubes may be necessary to ensure adequate nutrition and prevent aspiration pneumonia.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Respiratory Care:</strong> Chest physiotherapy, suction to clear secretions, and eventually mechanical ventilation may be needed as respiratory muscles weaken.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Seizure Management:</strong> Anti-seizure medications can help control epileptic episodes, though they may become less effective as the disease progresses.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Physical Therapy:</strong> Helps maintain muscle tone and joint flexibility for as long as possible, and can provide comfort through positioning and massage.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Palliative Care:</strong> Focuses on comfort, pain management, and quality of life for both the child and family.</p>

                        <h3>Experimental Treatments Under Research</h3>
                        <p><strong>Gene Therapy:</strong> Researchers are investigating ways to introduce functional copies of the HEXA gene into affected cells.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Enzyme Replacement Therapy:</strong> Attempts to deliver functional Hex A enzyme to affected tissues, though the blood-brain barrier presents significant challenges.</p>

                                <p>Tay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene that result in deficiency or absence of the Hexosaminidase A enzyme. Without this enzyme, GM2 gangliosides accumulate in nerve cells, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, causing progressive neurological damage.</p>
